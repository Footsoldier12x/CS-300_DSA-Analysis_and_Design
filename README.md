# CS-300_DSA-Analysis_and_Design

### What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
    ABCU's Computer Science department required planning and design for an advicing assistance software program. This will give advisors a tool to help students when enrolling     into their courses.

### How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
    The first step was to analyze which data structure would function best for the requirements delineated by ABCU. After testing vectors, linked lists, and binary trees, the     most fitting data structure ended up being a binary tree. 

### How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
    There were many unforeseen issues early on in the setup process because the instructor wanted student to use visual studio but the instructions were drawn from someone         utilizing eclipse. However, after figuring out how to setup Eclipse, the rest of the project went fairly smoothly.

### How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
    I learned to do research about the tools at my disposition before beginning to type any code. There is rarely a need to create individual tools from scratch since most         programming languages and platforms are very robust and probably have a library to assist you in simple tasks.

### How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
    The complexity of the programs I develop is continuously growing and the need to create maintainable, readalbe, and adaptable code is becoming more and more apparent.         There has beeen times in which I spend some time trying to understand a concept within my own code, and I can only imagine what someone else who did not code it would say.     Therefore, I have increased the amount and clarity of my comments within my code to assist other understand what the code is for.
